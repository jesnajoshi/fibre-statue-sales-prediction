# Fibre Statue Sales Prediction
Data analytics project to predict fibre statue sales using machine learning


## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical sales data of fibre statues to predict future demand using data analytics and machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Analyze sales trends and seasonal patterns
- Preprocess categorical and numerical data
- Build predictive models for sales forecasting
- Help businesses with inventory and demand planning

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Feature Encoding and Scaling
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Sales Prediction

## Insight
1.Seasonal Demand Pattern

Sales of fibre statues significantly increase during festival and religious seasons, while off-season periods show lower demand.
This indicates that seasonality is a major factor influencing sales.

2.Popular Statue Categories

Medium-sized and commonly worshipped statue categories contribute to the highest sales volume.
Niche or very large statues sell less frequently but generate higher individual revenue.

3.Price Sensitivity

Statues in the mid-price range have higher sales compared to very low or very high-priced items.
Customers prefer value-for-money products over premium pricing.

4.Impact of Location

Sales vary across locations, with urban and high-footfall areas showing better demand consistency.
Location plays an important role in planning inventory distribution.

5.Feature Importance

Features such as season, festival period, price range, and statue category have a strong influence on sales prediction.
Historical sales data is a reliable indicator for future forecasting.

6.Model Performance

Machine learning models like Random Forest / Decision Tree performed better than basic linear models due to non-linear sales patterns.
The selected model provides accurate predictions with low error rate.

7.Business Optimization

Using sales prediction, businesses can reduce overstocking and understocking.
Helps in planning production, inventory, and marketing strategies effectively.

## Result
The model provides accurate sales predictions and useful insights for business decision-making.
